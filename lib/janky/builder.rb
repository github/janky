module Janky
  # Triggers Jenkins builds and handles callbacks.
  #
  # The HTTP requests flow goes like this:
  #
  # 1. Send a Build request to the Jenkins server over HTTP. The resulting
  #    build URL is stored in Build#url.
  #
  # 2. Once Jenkins picks up the build and starts running it, it sends a callback
  #    handled by the `receiver` Rack app, which transitions the build into a
  #    building state.
  #
  # 3. Finally, Jenkins sends another callback with the build result and the
  #    build is transitioned to a completed and green/red state.
  #
  # The Mock adapter provides methods to simulate that flow without having to
  # go over the wire.
